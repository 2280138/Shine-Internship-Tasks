# Assignment 3 - Bug Reporting Assignment

## Project Overview
In this assignment, I explored the **Tutorial Ninja Demo Site** to identify and report bugs using a professional bug reporting format. The goal was to practice **functional, UI, and security testing** and learn how to document defects clearly and systematically.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, I learned to:
- Identify **functional, UI, and security issues** in a web application.
- Understand the **bug reporting process** followed in the industry.
- Document defects in a **structured and professional format**, including steps to reproduce, severity, priority, and expected vs actual results.

## Project Scope
During testing, I focused on:
- User **registration and login** workflows
- **Form validation** (name, mobile number, email, password)
- **Product browsing, search, and filtering**
- **Cart, checkout, and payment** functionalities
- **UI consistency and usability**
- **Security vulnerabilities**, including XSS and weak password handling

## Defect Statistics
| Severity  | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Critical  | 3     |
| High      | 6     |
| Medium    | 12    |
| Low       | 4     |
| **Total** |**25** |

**Key Learning**
By categorizing defects, I understood how severity impacts the priority of fixes and how documentation supports developers in resolving issues efficiently.
